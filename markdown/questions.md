### About Flowerpot

Information sharing is important. But reading content on platforms without proper warnings
  can be a harmful, triggering experience.

Flowerpot helps you share sensitive content safely by putting warnings first and asking readers’ consent before displaying.

<p>When you submit a post that could be unsafe for some readers, we ask you to add a specific content warning noting any sensitive topics.

We’ll then scramble up the content, showing only the content note.

To view the post, users can easily unscramble the content by clicking “display content”.

[See an example post](/posts/example)

Flowerpot is currently in beta, which means the data may get wiped occasionally, and features may appear and disappear without warning.

  <dl>
    <dt>What is Flowerpot?</dt>
    <dd>Flowerpot is an app which aims to let people share content of any kind (especially sensitive content) while ensuring readers consent to reading it.</dd>

    <dt>How does it work?</dt>
    <dd>When you create a Flowerpot post, the app takes the content you've written and scrambles it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13" target="_blank">ROT13</a>. This way, potentially sensitive content cannot be accidentally read. When (and if) those you've shared your post with want to read it, they can click a 'Decode' button to unscramble the content.</dd>

    <dt>Is there an example I can look at?</dt>
    <dd><a href="posts/example/">Yep</a>! The example post contains <b>no offensive content</b>, and you can interact with it to see how Flowerpot works.</dd>

    <dt>How do I make a new post?</dt>
    <dd>You go to the <a href="posts/new/">Create New Post</a> page, and fill in the form. You paste in your title, your content, and write a warning note. The note should let people know what kind of sensitive material the content might contain.</dd>

    <dt>What do I do with a new post once I've created it!</dt>
    <dd>When your encoded post is created, just copy the link&mdash; you can then share however you like.</dd>

    <dt>Can I edit or delete a post?</dt>
    <dd>No, you can't do either of these at the moment. This is because we didn't want to track account info (or any data about our users), and this means that actions like editing and deleting are tricky. You can always create a new Flowerpot post if you've made a mistake, or if you really want to delete the one you've made, <a href="mailto:flowerpot@flowerpot.fyi">send us an email</a> with the post link and a request to delete.</dd>

    <dt>How do I write a good warning note?</dt>
    <dd>Good question! It depends on the audience of your post, and its content. A good guideline is to try and give a general, broad idea of what your post is about, but without giving too many details. You want your readers to understand the potentially upsetting topics you discuss, but without offering too much details. It's hard, but not impossible. The Geek Feminism Wiki has  <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Trigger_warning" target="_blank">some great guidance</a>. Some examples:
      <ul>
        <li>"This post contains depiction or discussion of violence."</li>
        <li>"This post contains detailed descriptions of and extensive discussion of abuse."</li>
        <li>"Be careful; this article contains description of mental illness and its effects."</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Someone is abusing Flowerpot; what do I do?</dt>
    <dd>Every individual post has a 'Report Abuse' button associated with it; please use it if you see anyone misusing Flowerpot&mdash; this is not what the app is intended for. You can also contact us <a href="mailto:abuse@flowerpot.fyi">by email</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Why 'Flowerpot'?</dt>
    <dd>Just because. It was a work-in-progress name, and it stuck!</dd>

  <dt>Are my posts securely encrypted?</dt>
  <dd>No, they're not. The posts are just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13" target="_blank">ROT13</a>'d to encode them, not securely encrypt.</dd>
  <dt>Why aren't you securely encrypting posts?</dt>
  <dd>We're not encrypting securely because we do want content to remain readable; Flowerpot simply offers people the opportunity to consent to reading content, and those who might be afraid of posting potentially disturbing content to ask consent.</dd>
  <dt>Can I log in and save posts?</dt>
  <dd>Nope. To help minimise users' exposure to abuse, we made the decision not to store any login details.</dd>
