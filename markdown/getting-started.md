### Getting Started

Thanks for your interest in Flowerpot development! Let's get you set up.

First, you'll want to **install github and node** on your computer.

* [Github](http://desktop.github.com)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (use an installer)

Then, **open a terminal window / command prompt** and run the following:

* `npm install -g bower`
* `npm install -g ember-cli`

Next, **click the 'save to computer' button** on the flowerpot repository github page; this will clone the repo to your machine.

Then click **Repository -> Open** in Terminal...

...and run these commands:

 * `npm install`
 * `bower install`

**Done!** After this is complete you should be good to go! Just run `ember serve` in Terminal, and [visit the app in your browser](http://localhost:4200/)!
